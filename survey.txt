At Coros, problem solving is performed in small teams of humans.  We like to
verify candidates can work successfully in such an environment.

1.  If you have a blog, github, Twitter, or other public writing that you would
    like us to read, please share those URLs. Feel free to highlight any items
    you think we'd appreciate.

[

I do not have any articles on here, but I do have a few repositories you can check out!
https://gitlab.com/users/sdowning7/projects

2.  If you have participated in one or more technical communities (open
    source projects, electronics, astronomy, etc. professionally or as a
    hobby), please submit URLs to the forum posts, mailing list messages, or
    source repository change sets that show that participation.

3.  What's your favorite book about software or computing? What do you like
    about it?

[
I don't have a favorite book, but I do have a few favorite Youtube channels!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA
Computerphile coveres a lot of different computing topics. I like this channel because 
they cover a wide variet of interesting topics that I may not have considered looking into. 
I love digging into things and learning how they work, so the explorations of bugs like 
heartbleed and meltdown or how various encryption schemes work are really interesting to me.
They also have a bunch of great videos on the history of computing, which I find really cool
because they sometimes explain weird quirks of how computers do things that go way back to 
the start of computing.

Ben Eater has a series of videos where he builds a simple computer from the ground up. It's 
really interesting to me to see what actually goes into designing a computer and all of the 
underlying systems that bring different challenges that need to be tackled to get them all 
to work together nicely.

4.  What's your favorite website to consult while programming?

[
The first site I will often go to is a stack overflow, or stack exchange type of site, 
whichever one has the question I'm looking for. From there, I will refer to the documentation
for that language or library that I am using, to get more detail on the exact method or what 
the piece of code is actually doing.

5.  Coros's primary engineering team is located in California.  Select which
    form of employment authorization you currently have:

    [X] US citizen or permanent resident
    [ ] Current visa holder (or application in progress), but will need
[company] to transfer
    [ ] Need [company] to sponsor a new visa

6.  Finally, write a brief explanation about what challenges you are
    seeking at a systems startup.

[
When talking to Mr. Moore, I was really interested in the Maching Learning aspects of Coros. I
recently took an ML course at Northeastern and really enjoyed it. I would love to learn more about
how exactly it is being applied to logistics, and what other future problems it could be used for. 
I am looking forward to learning more about the challenges that the field of logistics has and what I can 
do to help Coros tackle them.

Software
--------

Coros's primary programming languages are C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Kotlin,
Python, Scala, and, on the browser, JavaScript.

1.  Write a brief program that in one of the above programming languages, given
    a list of HTTP and HTTPS URLs as arguments, returns the number of unique
    external URLs referenced in the response.  Your program must parse HTML
    document responses, although you may optionally choose to parse other
    document types for external URLs.  For example, an invocation with a list
    of URLs like should look something like

        $ program http://example.com http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/sample.html
        http://example.com 1
        http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/sample.html 18

    In a comment at the top of your main program file, please describe any
    limitations of your program.



2.  Provide an equivalent implementation of #1 in your favorite programming
    language.  (If you can't choose a favorite, pick a second language from our
    primary programming languages for your second implementation.)  In this
    program's comments, please describe any different limitations that apply to
    this implementation from those of #1.

Please provide your solutions in a compressed archive.  A README explaining
your programs' requirements for execution would be appreciated.
