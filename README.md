**1. scraper.go
I chose Go as the language I would be using for #1. I began looking into it after my 
conversation with Mr. Moore. I am enjoying it so far and am looking forward to using it more!

To run this program you can use:
$go run scraper.py [links]

If a URL can not be resolved, or there is an error parsing the HTML, -1 will be printed for
 the number of links found.

**2. scraper.py 
Python is currently my favorite language, and it also happens to be on the list of languages
that Coros uses!

You will need the following packages installed to run:
lxml
urllib
requests

This runs and behaves in the same way as scraper.go
$python3 scraper.py [links]

If a URL can not be resolved, or there is an error parsing the HTML, -1 will be printed for
 the number of links found.
